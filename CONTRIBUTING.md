## ðŸ¦¸ Contributing to Roboflow Notebooks

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Roboflow Notebooks as easy and transparent as possible.

- When creating new notebook, make sure to use our [template](https://github.com/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/_train-template.ipynb) as starting point. It contains all the elements that we would like to include in our notebooks from now on.
- When adding or editing notebooks, make sure to specify the versions of pip packages ðŸ“¦ you are using.

Please keep in mind that repository is still under construction ðŸš§. We will add more contribution guidelines soon.
